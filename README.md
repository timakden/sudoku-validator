# Sudoku validator

Create a command line tool (running on jvm) for validating a standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.

Command line: validate.bat puzzleName.txt

File format: csv format each line representing a row e.g.:

```
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
```

The program should return 0 (VALID) or non-zero (INVALID) value with an error text on stdout (in case of an invalid solution or file).

There should be unit tests covering a range of error conditions, and the project should be maven or gradle based.

It should be possible to unpack the code from a zip, generate test report, build it and use a batch file to call the code from a packaged jar.
